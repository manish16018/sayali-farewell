        Comment  : "To me, from day one you have been a mentor, a confidante and a guide in every way possible. The tiring office hours, the unacheivable tasks or confusing meetings made more sense with you around and you taught me the fact that there is always a solution you just have to find a way. You were an asset to the whole department. The knowledge that you shared with us and the learning you bought cannot be compared with anything. You have been a true and amazing co-worker and most of all a friend. Thank you so much for everything. Surely going to miss you here. I wish there were more moments of singing ed sheeran songs together.",
